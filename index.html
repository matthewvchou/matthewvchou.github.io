                        I'm a junior at the University of Notre Dame, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. With a strong passion for both machine learning and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), I am eager to explore the intersection of these fields. As I continue my academic journey, I'm excited to gain practical experience and collaborate with professionals who share my interests. My long-term goal is to leverage my skills in machine learning and HCI to make meaningful contributions to the tech industry by actively working on projects that reduce disparities, promote diversity, and create user-centered solutions that enhance the human experience for everyone.
